            <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and
                maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads,
                bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and
                railways. Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered
                the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, yes. COVID-19 can spread anywhere you may come into close contact with an infected
                    person. However, the risk of infection is much lower outdoors compared to indoor spaces.
                    Remember, the virus spreads mainly via respiratory droplets that are released from an infected
                    person through coughing, sneezing, talking or singing which then get into the mouth, nose or eyes of
                    people who are nearby. Short-range airborne (or aerosol) transmission is possible, particularly in
                    poorly ventilated, crowded indoor places. People may also become infected by touching their mouth,
                    nose or eyes, after touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, although emerging evidence
                    suggests that this does not play a significant role in COVID-19 transmission.</p>
